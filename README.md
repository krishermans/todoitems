# TodoItems Sample

This sample is based on [this tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api), but modifies it to use a [SQLite DB](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) (writing to a file). When you start the server, it will automatically migrate (and create) your database in a file called `TodoDB.db`.
Furthermore, EF Core is implemented according to the guidelines outlined by Julie Lerman in [this Pluralsight coure](https://app.pluralsight.com/course-player?clipId=9973f0a0-a9d6-476b-83d9-26c751e7a1c7).
